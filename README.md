# Working with the while and do-while Loop

## Step 1

This program is not user friendly. Run it a few times and see why. Add to the code so that the program is more user friendly.

## Step 2

Replace the while loop with a do-while loop. The new loop would have this structure:

	do
	{

	  // body of the loop

	} 
	while (letter != 'x');
Now run the program and notice that the execution of the program is not affected. Think about why that is the case and leave a comment in the code explaining why.
